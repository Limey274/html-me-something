					<h2>New Zealand</h2>
					<p>The first time I ever traveled outside of the country, was to New Zealand. My rugby team, Liberty Rugby Foottball Club, was invited to play some teams across the island.
             Never having been outside the US, I didn't know what to expect. After arriving, I was blown away about how green and lush everything was. It truley was a paradise. Upon arriving to Whakatane
             a beach town in the north of NZ, we were brought to Ohope Beach, a local favorite for lounging and relaxing. It was a great start to my first trip.

					<h2>London</h2>
					<p>My next trip was to London, England. While there, my team and I traveled and played 2 teams throughout the country. One team in particular was the Eltham College Rugby Club in London. They were a tough team and we eventually lost. It was a well played game on both sides and it tought us a lot about our own strategy.</p>

					<h2>Edinburgh</h2>
					<p>After our travels in London, we went north straight into Scotland. During our time in Scotland, we stopped in Edinburgh. We visited Edinburgh Castle and roamed the city in search for trinkets and beer. We were not disappointed.</p>

						<p>Our rugby games were great as well. The West of Scotland Football club were full of passionate players. They wroked hard as we did, but in the end we were victorious </p>

					<h2>Dublin</h2>
					<p>More recently, after joining the military and nearing the end of my second contract, I took a trip to Ireland. My family have stromg roots in Ireland so taking a trip to my families ancestral home was much more meaningful and impactful.
						 I was confused for a local more times then i could count when I was there, and my accent was getting pretty good. Travelng to the Blarney castle, strolling the streets of Dublin, and more importantly, having a guinness at the Guinness factory. </p>
